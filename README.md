# Machine Learning Implementations

This repository contains implementations of various machine learning algorithms from scratch, along with comparisons to their `sklearn` counterparts.

## Decision Tree Classifier (CART)
The `DecisionTreeCART` class implements the CART algorithm for decision trees. It supports fitting to data, making predictions, and evaluating accuracy.

Using the dataset from Kaggle [Dataset Link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kaushiksuresh147/customer-segmentation/data), we preprocess the data and train both our custom decision tree and `sklearn`'s implementation for comparison.
